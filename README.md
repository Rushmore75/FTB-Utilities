# What?
I'm resurrecting this mod for a custom modpack use case. It has (thus far) required me to build several of the dependencies from source, many of them are from forks on this account.

Such as:
* [FTBLib](https://github.com/Rushmore75/FTB-Library-Legacy)
* [KubeJS](https://github.com/Rushmore75/KubeJS)
* [Aurora](https://github.com/Rushmore75/Aurora)
